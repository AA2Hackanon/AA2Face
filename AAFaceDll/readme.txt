new stuff, new readme. how to use:
1: copy items.txt, AAFaceDll.dll and config.txt into the same folder where the AA2Edit.exe is
2: copy exe anywhere
3: run Maker until its at the very first screen with the picture of default girl smiling at you and all the buttons
4: execute AAFace.exe. if the maker was started with admin rights, start AAFace.exe with admin rights.
5: pray that it worked (if it keeps silent, it probably worked).


for hotkeys n stuff (one anon aksed for it), take a look at the config.txt
there were some bugfixes. config now also supports ASCII-hotkeys.
