Q: When i try to start AAFace.exe, it complains about missing MSVCRxx or VCRUNTIMEyyy (probably 140) missing
A: you need the vc++2015 redistributable packages. they are the c++ standard library from microsoft
	and are needed for every c++ program compiled with visual studio. Usually these would be installed
	with one of your other games, but 2015 is pretty new still, and game development takes time.
	you can get them here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145&751be11f-ede8-5a0c-058c-2ee190a24fa6=True
	note: if you are on a 64-bit system, for some reason, you need both the 32-bit and the 64-bit version. no idea why, shouldnt be that way.

Q: Is this the new version? Where can i get the latest version?
A: There is a github for this project: https://github.com/AA2Hackanon/AA2Face/releases

Q: When starting the editor using AAFace, it sometimes crashes / certain features dont quite work
A: Make sure you started AAFace.exe at the first screen, with the start button and the picture of default girl.
	if you start it after the preview window etc are allready loaded, some injected code might not be executed
	and things will go wrong

Q: I can choose only a nipple type >3 or only a nipple color >7, but when i do both, nothing happens. How come?
A: Nipple color and type are actually not as seperated as the buttons may make you believe. There is a single image
	file for every nipple and color combination. When modders made additional types, they did not know that and what
	additional colors may be introduced later and could not possibly make images for these colors, and vice versa.
	Yes, that is dumb. It should be image + color.

Q: Why do the random buttons still only choose normal slots?
A: To modify the random buttons, i would have to know exactly which slots exists and which not. While the editor
	techincally has ways to figure that out, it only does that for the slots it actually displays, and making him
	do it for other slots as well is awfully complicated and time consuming. 

Q: The list.txt file is tedious. Why dont you use the Override.xml system from ReiEdit?
A: if you are willing to write a XML parser and put it in the program, you are more than willing to do so.
